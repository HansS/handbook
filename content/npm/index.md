# Enterprise Private npm

In this getting started guide you will get setup with your Enterprise Private npm registry from Nodejitsu as well as learn about some of the best practices for working with `package.json` files.

## 1. Configure the npm CLI

Just like the public registry, the `npm` CLI program is what you'll use to install, publish and otherwise interact with npm modules. Nodejitsu Enterprise private npm has two changes in the configuration to your npm CLI client:

```
npm config set always-auth true
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

Why do you need to do these things?

* _Every request requires authentication:_ This means that users you have not authorized cannot download packages from your private npm. Since this is not the default behavior of the public npm you need to set:
```
npm config set always-auth true
```
* _Don't be strict about SSL:_ Isaac Schlueter runs his own CA for `registry.npmjs.org` which we are in the process of getting setup for `npmjitsu.co`. In the meantime however, we are using a wildcard certificate (e.g. `*.npmjitsu.co`) which causes spurriour SSL warnings unless you set:
```
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

### 2. Start making requests against your private npm

Requests can be made against your private npm in two ways:

* _Set the registry for all requests:_ This means that every request will hit your private registry
```
  npm config set registry https://your-subdomain.npmjitsu.co
```
* _Use the `--reg` flag when necessary:_ The `--reg` flag (short for `--registry`) will allow you to make any request against your private registry:
```
  npm info your-private-module --reg http://your-subdomain.npmjitsu.co
```

**We recommend that you use the `--reg` flag when necessary combined with the `publishConfig` in your package.json.**

### 3. Login to the web interface

```
http://your-subdomain.npmjitsu.com
```

### PROTIP: Publish modules using `publishConfig`

The `publishConfig` in your package.json does the following (from the [npm documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/files/package.json.md#publishconfig)):

> This is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time. It's especially handy if you want to set the
> tag or registry, so that you can ensure that a given package is not tagged with "latest" or published to the
> global public registry by default.
>
> Any config values can be overridden, but of course only "tag" and "registry" probably matter for the purposes
> of publishing.

For example:

``` js
  {
    "publishConfig": { "registry": "https://your-subdomain.npmjitsu.co" }
  }
```

The benefits of using `publishConfig` is that it avoids accidental publishes to the public registry due to user error. Take for example a developer on your team who has not properly configured their machine by running `npm config set registry` or using the `--reg` flag. _That command would send your code public._ By using the `publishConfig` property you avoid that because it is part of your application.
